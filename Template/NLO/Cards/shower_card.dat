# DECAY CHANNELS
# Write down the decay channels for the resonances, to be performed by the shower.
# The syntax (for a two-body decay) is
# DM_I = M > D1 D2 @ BR @ ME
# where I = 1, ..., 99, M is the decaying resonance, D1, D2 are the decay products
# (up to D5 if  such a decay is supported by the shower), BR is the branching ratio
# (only used by the HERWIG6 shower, ignored otherwise) and ME is the type of matrix
# element to be used in the decay (only used by HERWIG6, ignored otherwise).
# BR's are correctly understood by HERWIG6 only if they add up to one and only if
# no more than three modes are required for a given resonance.
# ME corresponds to the third entry of subroutine HWMODK, see the relevant manual.
# Examples of syntax:
# Z -> e+ e- or mu+ mu- with BR = 0.5 each
# DM_1 = 23 > -11 11 @ 0.5d0 @ 100
# DM_2 = 23 > -13 13 @ 0.5d0 @ 100
# H -> tau+ tau- with BR = 1
# DM_3 = 25 > -15 15 @ 1.0d0 @ 0
# t -> nu_e e+ b @ 1d0
# DM_4 = 6 > 12 -11 5 @ 1d0 @ 100
# WARNING: for HERWIG6 the order of decay products in >2-body decays IS RELEVANT.
# WARNING: 1 -> n decays (with n > 2) are handled by PYTHIA6 and PYTHIA8 through
# a sequence of 1 -> 2 decays.

# EXTRA LIBRARIES/ANALYSES
# The following lines need to be changed if the user does not want to create the
# StdHEP/HEPMC file, but to directly run his/her own analyse.
# Please note that this works only for HW6 and PY6, and that the analysis should
# be in the HWAnalyzer/ (or PYAnalyzer/) folder. 
# Please use files in those folders as examples.
# "None" and an empty value are equivalent.
